## Locations

## Standing Stones Base
This is the base new players spawn in and the location of the boss stones

### Portals
**sg-X** Return Portal - for emergency use.  *Usage Notes: If possible create two portals when making a new connection to sg-x, one to return with, and one that can be anchored to a new portal.  This way a return portal can be made in a base and the sg-x tage removed from the sites portal, freeing sg-x for use.*
**Unassigned Portal** Keyed into your destination and go.

## Merchant Base
The merchant is located at this base.  Not intended for building.  The base is nestled under a rock.  This is a large forest biome so if needed could be used as a place to harvest forest resources. 
### Portal
**sg-M:** Dialable portal for now. 

## Forest Nexus
This location appears to be nestled inbetween a plains and a large swamp biome. It also is an easy sail south to what may be our Mistlands base. Located on the coast, in an abandoned tower. 
### Portal
**sg-1:** Safe portal in an abandon tower. 

## Southern Reach Base
This is a mistlands base currently located on a single rock jutting out of the ocean, local exploration shows a promising stone pillar that would make for a good base.  Directly south is the Ashlands biome, this is about as close as we can get for now. 
North of this base is the largest mistlands biome i've ever seen. Very promising! A channel through the mistlands biomes on either side makes for a good passage for hauling ores without worrying about mist.  

### Portal
**sg-2:** Come prepared with the makings for a boat and weaponry!
